# String Utils Refactor

This repo contains a simple utility function to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string.

## What was done?

- Refactored the original function to improve readability using modern JavaScript array methods.
- Added JSDoc comments for better understanding.
- Added a benchmark script to compare performance before and after refactoring.

## Benchmark Results

Run benchmark using:

```bash
node benchmark.js
